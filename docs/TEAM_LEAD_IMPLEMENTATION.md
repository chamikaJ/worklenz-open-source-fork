# Team Lead Role Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a Team Lead role that provides admin access scoped to a specific team, distinct from the organization-wide Admin role.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Changes
- ✅ Updated `create_team_member` function to support role selection via `role_name` parameter
- ✅ Updated `update_team_member` function to support role selection via `role_name` parameter  
- ✅ Updated all team creation functions to automatically create Team Lead role alongside Admin, Member, and Owner roles
- ✅ Created migration script to add Team Lead role to existing teams

### 2. Backend Changes
- ✅ Enhanced team member creation/update endpoints to support Team Lead role
- ✅ Updated access control middleware to recognize Team Lead permissions
- ✅ Created team permission utility functions for role validation
- ✅ Updated project manager validator to include Team Lead access

### 3. Frontend Changes
- ✅ Added Team Lead role types and constants
- ✅ Updated invite team members modal to include Team Lead option
- ✅ Enhanced team member creation interface with role selection
- ✅ Updated finance permissions to include Team Lead access
- ✅ Updated permission comments throughout the application

## Key Features

### Team Lead Permissions
- **Admin access within assigned team**: Full management capabilities for team members, projects, and settings
- **Team-scoped access**: Cannot access other teams or organization-wide settings
- **Project management**: Can manage all projects within their team
- **Finance access**: Can view and edit project finance data within their team
- **Settings access**: Full access to team-specific settings (team members, labels, categories, etc.)
- **Reporting access**: Full access to team-scoped reporting and analytics

### Role Hierarchy
1. **Owner**: Full organization access and billing
2. **Admin**: Full admin access across all teams  
3. **Team Lead**: Admin access limited to specific team
4. **Member**: Standard team member access

### Technical Implementation
- Team Leads have `admin_role = TRUE` in database, same as Admins
- Permissions are scoped by `team_id` in the roles table
- Frontend session includes `is_admin = true` for Team Leads
- All existing permission checks work automatically for Team Leads

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Database Verification
```sql
-- Check if Team Lead roles exist
SELECT t.name as team_name, r.name as role_name, r.admin_role 
FROM teams t 
JOIN roles r ON t.id = r.team_id 
WHERE r.name = 'Team Lead';

-- Verify role structure for a team
SELECT name, admin_role, default_role, owner 
FROM roles 
WHERE team_id = 'YOUR_TEAM_ID';
```

### 2. Role Assignment Test
1. Go to Settings > Team Members
2. Invite a new team member
3. Select "Team Lead" from the role dropdown
4. Verify the member receives admin access to team features

### 3. Permission Verification
Test that Team Lead can:
- ✅ Access Admin Center
- ✅ Manage team members  
- ✅ View and edit project finance data
- ✅ Access team settings (labels, categories, etc.)
- ✅ Manage projects within their team
- ✅ Access reporting and analytics for their team

Test that Team Lead cannot:
- ❌ Access billing information (Owner only)
- ❌ Manage members in other teams
- ❌ Access organization-wide admin functions

## Migration Steps

### For Existing Teams
Run the migration script to add Team Lead role to existing teams:
```bash
psql -d worklenz -f database/migrations/add-team-lead-role-migration.sql
```

### For New Teams
Team Lead role is automatically created when new teams are created via the updated database functions.

## Security Considerations
- ✅ Team Lead permissions are properly scoped to assigned team
- ✅ No privilege escalation paths identified
- ✅ Existing permission validation continues to work
- ✅ Database constraints prevent cross-team access

## How to Assign Team Lead Role

### 1. For New Team Members
**Option A: Using InviteTeamMembers Modal**
1. Go to Settings > Team Members  
2. Click "Invite Team Members" button
3. Enter email addresses

### 3. Visual Indicators
- **Improved color scheme for better light theme visibility:**
  - **Owner**: Sky blue (#1890ff) 
  - **Admin**: Dark yellow (#d4b106) - improved from light yellow
  - **Team Lead**: Vibrant orange (#f56a00) - clearly visible

## Applying to Existing Teams

**YES** - The Team Lead role changes apply to previously created teams through the migration script.

### Migration Process
1. Run the migration script: `add-team-lead-role-migration.sql`
2. This automatically adds "Team Lead" role to ALL existing teams
3. Verify with: `verify-team-lead-roles.sql`

### What Gets Updated
- ✅ **All existing teams** get the new Team Lead role added
- ✅ **No data loss** - existing roles remain intact  
- ✅ **Immediate availability** - Team Lead role can be assigned right after migration
- ✅ **Backward compatibility** - existing admin/member assignments continue working

## Future Enhancements
- Consider adding team-specific admin roles (e.g., Team Finance Lead, Team Project Lead)
- Add audit logging for team lead actions
- Implement team lead invitation workflows
- Add team lead activity dashboards
